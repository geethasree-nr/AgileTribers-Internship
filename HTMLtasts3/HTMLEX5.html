                <p>Cats are small, furry mammals known for their independence, curiosity, and playful nature. Scientifically named <em>Felis catus,</em> they have been living alongside humans for thousands of years as beloved pets and skilled hunters. With their sharp claws, flexible bodies, and excellent night vision, cats are natural predators, yet they also enjoy affection and companionship. They are often admired for their cleanliness, as they groom themselves regularly. Cats use meows, purrs, and body language to communicate with humans, making them both mysterious and charming. Their ability to live comfortably in small spaces and their low-maintenance care make them ideal pets for many households. Whether sleeping peacefully or playfully chasing a toy, cats bring joy, relaxation, and companionship to millions of people around the world.
